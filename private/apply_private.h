 * behaviour.
 * If the attribute is valid, the query returns 1. If it is not valid, the query
 * returns 0.
 *
 * @const DISPATCH_APPLY_ATTR_QUERY_MAXIMUM_WORKERS
 * Calculates an upper bound of how many parallel worker threads
 * dispatch_apply_with_attr could create when running a workload with the
 * specified attribute. This will include the thread calling
 * dispatch_apply_with_attr as a worker. This is an upper bound; depending on
 * conditions, such as the load of other work on the system and the execution
 * context where dispatch_apply_with_attr is called, fewer parallel worker
 * threads may actually be created.
 *
 * A good use of this query is to determine the size of a working arena
 * (such as preallocated memory space or other resources) appropriate for the
 * the maximum number of workers. This API can be used in coordination
 * with the worker_index block argument in dispatch_apply_with_attr to provide
 * each parallel worker thread with their own slice of the arena.

 * dispatch_apply_with_attr as a worker. This is only a guess; depending on
 * conditions, dispatch_apply_with_attr may actually create more or fewer
 * parallel worker threads than this value.
 *
 * Compared to QUERY_MAXIMUM_WORKERS, this query tries to predict the behavior
 * of dispatch_apply_with_attr more faithfully. The number of parallel worker
 * threads to be used may be affected by aspects of the current execution context
 * like the thread's QOS class, scheduling priority, queue hierarchy, and current
 * workloop; as well as transitory aspects of the system like power state and
 * computational loads from other tasks. For those reasons, repeating this query
 * for the same attribute may produce a different result.

/*!
 * @function dispatch_apply_with_attr
 *
 * * @abstract
 * Submits a block for parallel invocation, with an attribute structure
 * describing the workload.
 *
 * @discussion
 * Submits a block for parallel invocation. The system will try to use worker
 * threads that match the configuration of the current thread. The system will
 * try to start an appropriate number of worker threads to maximimize
 * throughput given the available hardware and current system conditions. An
 * attribute structure that describes the nature of the workload may be passed.
 * The system will use the attribute's properties to improve its scheduling
 * choices, such as how many worker threads to create and how to distribute them
 * across processors.
 *
 * This function waits for all invocations of the task block to complete before
 * returning.
 *
 * Each invocation of the block will be passed 2 arguments:
 *    - the current index of iteration
 *    - the index of the worker thread invoking the block
 *
 * The worker index will be in the range [0, n)
 * where n = dispatch_apply_attr_query(attr, DISPATCH_APPLY_ATTR_QUERY_MAXIMUM_WORKERS, 0)
 *
 * Worker threads may start in any order. Some worker indexes within the
 * permissible range may not actually be used, depending on conditions.
 * Generally, one worker thread will use one worker index, but this is not
 * guaranteed; worker index MAY NOT match thread one-to-one. No assumptions
 * should be made about which CPU a worker runs on. Two invocations of
 * the block MAY have different worker indexes even if they run on the same
 * thread or the same processor. However, two invocations of the block running
 * at the same time WILL NEVER have the same worker index.
 *
 * When this API is called inside another dispatch_apply_with_attr or
 * dispatch_apply, it will execute as a serial loop.
 *
 * @param iterations
 * The number of iterations to perform.
 *
 * The choice of how to divide a large workload into a number of iterations can
 * have substantial effects on the performance of executing that workload.
 * If the number of iterations is very small, the system may not effectively
 * spread and balance the work across the available hardware. As a rough
 * guideline, the number of iterations should be at least three times the maximum
 * worker index. On the other hand, a workload should not be finely divided into
 * a huge number of iterations, each doing only a miniscule amount of work, since
 * there is a small overhead cost of accounting and invocation for each iteration.
 *
 * @param attr
 * The dispatch_apply_attr_t describing specialized properties of the workload.
 * This value can be NULL. If non-NULL, the attribute must have been initialized
 * with dispatch_apply_attr_init().
 *
 * If the attribute requests properties that are invalid or meaningless on this
 * system, the function will have undefined behaviour. This is a programming
 * error. An attribute's validity can be checked with dispatch_apply_attr_query.
 *
 * @param block
 * The block to be invoked the specified number of iterations.
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.
